        <h3> Microseismicity modeling</h3>
        At the Swiss Seismological Service I model wave propagation of microseismic events in the <a href="https://utahforge.com/">Utah FORGE</a> site and related rock labs. The obtained waveforms will allow us to test detection and location algorithms, and will be a first step towards the application of full waveform inversion techniques in geothermal reservoirs. This work is done in the context of the <a href="https://ethz.ch/en/news-and-events/eth-news/news/2016/10/geothermal-energy-a-community-effort.html">DEEP project</a> in and collaboration with <a href="www.mondaic.com">Mondaic AG</a>.

        <h3> Basin resonances and site effects</h3>
        For my past position as a postdoctoral fellow at University of Washington, I studied the basin response of the Mexico city basin and its change through time with the help of ambient noise recordings, exploring recently deployed sensors by <a href="https://grillo.io/" target="_blank" style="border-bottom: 1px solid"> Grillo<a/>.<br/>
        During my MSc project, under the supervision of <a href="http://seismo.org/ValerioPoggi/" target="_blank" style="border-bottom: 1px solid"> Dr. Valerio Poggi </a>, Prof. Donat FÃ¤h, and others, I studied the <a href="https://academic.oup.com/gji/article/198/2/795/595229" target="_blank" style="border-bottom: 1px solid">seismic response of the sediment fill</a> of the deep, glacially carved Rhone valley. The narrow, elongated, thick sedimentary deposit produces strong resonances whose modes can be observed in the ambient noise.

        <h3> Ambient seismic source inversion </h3>
        I continuously develop <a href="https://se.copernicus.org/preprints/se-2020-57/" target="_blank"style="border-bottom: 1px solid" >numerical modeling procedures</a> for auto- and cross-correlations of ambient seismic noise propagating through three-dimensional Earth structure. Such models form the basis for iterative inversion obtaining the time-, location- and frequency- dependent source power spectral density of ambient noise sources. This work was started during my PhD in the <a href="https://cos.ethz.ch/" target="_blank" style="border-bottom: 1px solid">ETH SWP group</a>, and current members of the group actively co-develop these methods.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        <h3> Sources of the Earth's "hum" </h3>
        In a first application of iterative noise source inversion with 3-D seismic structure, we constructed a model for the <a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/2017JB014738" target="_blank" style="border-bottom: 1px solid">sources of the Earth's hum<a/> (see the pitifully aliased gif above!) during Northern and Southern hemisphere winter.
